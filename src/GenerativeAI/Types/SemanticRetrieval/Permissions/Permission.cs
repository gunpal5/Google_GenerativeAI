/// A role is a collection of permitted operations that allows users to perform specific actions on PaLM API resources.
/// To make them available to users, groups, or service accounts, you assign roles.
/// When you assign a role, you grant permissions that the role contains.

/// <li>reader can use the resource (<see cref="TunedModel"/>, <see cref="Corpus"/>) for inference</li>
